# Bank-loan-prediction-using-EDA-and-DPL
The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don't have assurance if the applicant can repay the loan with no difficulties. In our Project, we built a predictive model to predict if an applicant is eligible for the loan or not. 
In our project we are predicting the approval of the loan on the basis of the property area ,loan amount,self employed,credit score, Applicant's monthly income, marital status, Dependents.
